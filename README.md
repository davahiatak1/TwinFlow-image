## 📰 News

- We release tutorials on MNIST to provide core implementation of TwinFlow!
- We release **TwinFlow-Qwen-Image-v1.0**! And we are also working on **Z-Image-Turbo to make it faster!**

## ⚙️ Key Features

1. **Simple and Memory-Efficient Framework**
   - **No JVPs:** Unlike sCM and MeanFlow, we require no JVP operations, making the method highly memory-friendly.
   - **No GANs:** Unlike DMD2, We eliminate the need for adversarial loss, removing the complexity of training discriminators.
   - **No Auxiliary Networks:** Unlike distribution matching methods like VSD/DMD, We require no fixed teacher models for distillation and no additional fake score networks for distribution matching.

This feature is demonstrated by our successful full-parameter few-step training of the Qwen-Image-20B.

2. **Flexible Initialization: "Start with Any Model"**
   - **Further Distillation:** Thanks to the one-model design, our method can learn the score function starting from any stage, _enabling further distillation on already distilled models._

To verify this flexibility, try our method directly on the MNIST tutorials (random initialization) and stay tuned for our faster Z-Image-Turbo (distilled model initialization).

## 💪 Open-source Plans

- [x] Release inference and sampler code for TwinFlow-Qwen-Image-v1.0.
- [x] Release training tutorials on MNIST for understanding.
- [ ] Release training code on SD3.5.
- [ ] Release faster Z-Image-Turbo.
- [ ] Release large-scale training code.

### Overview

We introduce TwinFlow, a framework that realizes high-quality 1-step and few-step generation without the pipeline bloat.

Instead of relying on external discriminators or frozen teachers, TwinFlow creates an internal "twin trajectory". By extending the time interval to $t\in[−1,1]$, we utilize the negative time branch to map noise to "fake" data, creating a self-adversarial signal directly within the model.

Then, the model can rectify itself by minimizing the difference of the velocity fields between real trajectory and fake trajectory, i.e. the $\Delta_\mathrm{v}$. The rectification performs distribution matching as velocity matching, which gradually transforms the model into a 1-step/few-step generator.

Key Advantages:
- **One-model Simplicity.** We eliminate the need for any auxiliary networks. The model learns to rectify its own flow field, acting as the generator, fake/real score. No extra GPU memory is wasted on frozen teachers or discriminators during training.
- **Scalability on Large Models.** TwinFlow is **easy to scale on 20B full-parameter training** due to the one-model simplicity. In contrast, methods like VSD, SiD, and DMD/DMD2 require maintaining three separate models for distillation, which not only significantly increases memory consumption—often leading OOM, but also introduces substantial complexity when scaling to large-scale training regimes.

### Tutorials

In the `tutorials/mnist` directory, we provide training code for MNIST that closely follows the implementation described in the paper, intended for tutorial purposes. This tutorial includes the core implementations of $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{base}$ and $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{TwinFlow}$.

To run TwinFlow training:

```bash
cd tutorials/mnist
python main.py --using_twinflow --save_dir ./outputs/twinflow
```

To run training without $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{TwinFlow}$:

```bash
cd tutorials/mnist
python main.py --save_dir ./outputs/rcgm
```

### Inference Demo

Install the latest diffusers:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

Run inference demo `inference.py`:

```python
python inference.py
```

We recommend to sample for 2~4 NFEs:

```python
# 4 NFE config
sampler_config = {
    "sampling_steps": 4,
    "stochast_ratio": 1.0,
    "extrapol_ratio": 0.0,
    "sampling_order": 1,
    "time_dist_ctrl": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
    "rfba_gap_steps": [0.001, 0.5],
}

# 2 NFE config
sampler_config = {
    "sampling_steps": 2,
    "stochast_ratio": 1.0,
    "extrapol_ratio": 0.0,
    "sampling_order": 1,
    "time_dist_ctrl": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
    "rfba_gap_steps": [0.001, 0.6],
}
```
